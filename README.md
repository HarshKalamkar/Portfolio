# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my work, projects, and skills in web development. The website features a responsive design, smooth scrolling, and interactive animations to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clickable links that smoothly scroll to different sections of the page.
- **Mobile Menu**: A collapsible mobile menu that enhances navigation on smaller screens.
- **Project Cards**: Display of various projects with animations when they come into view.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form that can be filled out by visitors (with form submission logic implemented).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: The structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling the components, including animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and smooth scroll functionality.
- **Intersection Observer API**: Used for animating project cards when they come into view as the user scrolls down.
